         Growing up as a homeschooled child for most of my life, socializing and making friends with other kids my age wasn't really my strong suit. However, growing up in a household full of artists, both fine and performing arts, I made friends with the things I had around me, such as pencils, paper, Legos, and technology, to express my creativity. My creativity was and still is my best friend that I could rely on and that is always by my side.

         Now, as a senior drama major at LaGuardia, everything has changed. Every unique character I portray, and every scene I perform in, I feel connected not only to myself but to a community of fellow dreamers, actors, artists, dancers, and musicians. My solitary artistic journey has blossomed into something greater than I could have imagined. Those countless hours spent bringing stories to life in my bedroom through drawing, filmmaking, and acting have helped me better grasp who I am and how I want to influence the world. I want to ensure that everyone, especially kids like me who grew up feeling unseen or unheard, can discover the power of self-expression.
